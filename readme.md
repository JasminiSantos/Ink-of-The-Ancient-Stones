# Ink of The Ancient Stones

Ink of The Ancient Stones is an immersive, interactive experience designed exclusively for the iPad.

Designed to be both educational and entertaining, Ink of The Ancient Stones is perfect for history enthusiasts, students, educators, and anyone interested in the rich tapestry of Mesoamerican cultures. Join us in preserving the legacy of one of the most fascinating ancient civilizations in the world.

## Companion Website

These submissions serve as a collective inspiration and a testament to the living legacy of the Maya civilization.
